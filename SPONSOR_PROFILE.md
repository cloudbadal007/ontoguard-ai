## What I'm Building

**OntoGuard** is the semantic firewall for AI agents—a production-ready validation engine that prevents costly mistakes before they happen.

### The Problem We're Solving

- **$4.6M in unauthorized transactions** - Real-world example of AI agents making expensive mistakes
- **73% of production AI failures** are due to semantic errors, not code bugs
- **90% of AI agent deployments** lack proper business rule validation

### The Solution

OntoGuard validates every AI agent action against OWL ontologies before execution, ensuring:
- ✅ **Zero unauthorized actions** - Catch violations before they cause damage
- ✅ **Business rule enforcement** - Define rules in OWL, enforce automatically
- ✅ **Production ready** - 244+ tests, battle-tested validation engine
- ✅ **Framework agnostic** - Works with LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI, and more

**Open source, MIT licensed, free forever.**
